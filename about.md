"I am a hybrid"
---------------

## Bryan Veloso http://quora.com/Bryan-Veloso

I am a hybrid addicted to two things: freedom and passion. Lack of either drives me away, whether it's from a project, a freelance gig or a job.

I am an eternal student of the game; my nature for being a jack-of-all-trades allowing me to overcome any challenge put in front of me. I might not be the perfect choice for a specific challenge, but I will always persevere.

Luck is a skill I cherish. Ambition runs through my veins.

Someday I'll succeed, but I'm a bit busy making sure the people I care about do.
